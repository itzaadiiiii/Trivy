**Note :**  ***( This is job code will run successfully but will give exit code if your code has critical vulnerabilities )***   we ran it on gitlab where we installed trivy on runner
**Allow pipeline to pass even if CRITICAL vulns exist** 
```
    - trivy fs --exit-code 0 --severity CRITICAL .
```
**Just replace with exit-code=1 to 0 if found**
